## Exercise 1: Warming up exercise
Introduction to small CRISPR on-target model in Tensorflow / Keras and use it to train a small ontarget efficiency model on real data.

## Exercise 2: Extracting features from deep learning
Deep learning does not easily lend itself to extraction of feature importance, like in the example of CRISPR where one could wish to know the importance of e.g. the first nucleotide of the NGG pam for the efficiency of the guide. In this exercise we will look at a way around this problem by masking out parts of the input sequence or of the energy parameter from the model input.

## Exercise 3: Convolutions in CRISPR on-target
In this exercise we will take a look at what are the actual outcome of the convolutions of the on-target sequence in the deep learning model.
